# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that provides individualized financial planning services, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company sought to modernize its software by incorporating secure communication and file verification mechanisms to protect client data and financial information. Specifically, the company needed a data verification step using a checksum to ensure the integrity and security of transferred files.
# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
When identifying Artemis Financial’s software security vulnerabilities, I effectively assessed areas needing encryption, secure communications, and vulnerability testing. Identifying these vulnerabilities is critical, as secure coding prevents unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential financial losses. Implementing strong security measures ensures the protection of sensitive client information and enhances trust in the company's services.
# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
One of the more challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring the proper implementation of encryption techniques and HTTPS enforcement while maintaining software functionality. However, running security tests, such as dependency checks and functional testing, was particularly helpful in verifying the effectiveness of the implemented security measures.
# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase layers of security, I integrated AES encryption for data protection, generated a self-signed certificate for secure communications, and implemented checksum verification to ensure file integrity. In the future, I would continue using automated vulnerability scanning tools, penetration testing, and security frameworks to identify and mitigate risks effectively.
# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the software remained functional and secure, I rigorously tested the refactored code using functional testing and security validation tools. I checked for errors, verified HTTPS connections, and conducted checksum validation to confirm that no new vulnerabilities were introduced during the process.
# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Throughout this project, I used tools such as Java Keytool for certificate generation, AES for encryption, and security testing frameworks for vulnerability assessment. These tools and best practices will be valuable in future projects requiring secure software development.
# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
For future employers, I can showcase this project as an example of my ability to develop secure software solutions, implement encryption techniques, and perform vulnerability assessments. This demonstrates my proficiency in secure coding, cybersecurity best practices, and software development.
